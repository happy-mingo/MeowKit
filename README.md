#### Possible Issues & Solutions

##### a. Laser char
- The black residue on the edges of the laser-cut honeycomb cardboard is harmless.  
  - Avoid direct contact with the cut edges.  
  - If any dust gets on your hands, simply wash them before handling the device. 

##### b. Shipping and handling
- During transport, the battery may be discharged or the back cover may become loose.  
  - Recharge using the USB-C cable until the red LED turns off (indicating full charge).  
  - Tighten the back cover screws with a T5 screwdriver if needed.  

##### c. A/B button stiffness
- The A/B buttons may feel slightly stiff at first.  
  - With repeated use, pressing and rebound will become smoother and the tactile feel will improve.
