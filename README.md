#### Possible Issues & Solutions

##### a. Laser char
- The black residue on the edges of the laser-cut honeycomb cardboard is harmless.  
  - Avoid direct contact with the cut edges.  
  - If any dust gets on your hands, simply wash them before handling the device. 

##### b. Shipping and handling
- During transport, the battery may be discharged or the back cover may become loose.  
  - Recharge using the USB-C cable until the red LED turns off (indicating full charge).  
  - Tighten the back cover screws with a T5 screwdriver if needed.  

##### c. A/B button stiffness
- The A/B buttons may feel slightly stiff at first.  
  - With repeated use, pressing and rebound will become smoother and the tactile feel will improve.

#### BLE BEACON

Custom BLE advertising packets can trigger native pairing or connection pop-ups on iOS, Android, and Windows devices‚Äîcommonly known as a ‚Äúpopup attack.‚Äù For example, it can spoof Nearby Actions modals and Proximity Pair pop-ups on iOS and iPadOS, effectively simulating native system dialogs.  

![BLE BEACON Demo](2.assets/ble_beacon.webp)

Given the 29 devices and the 3 advertisement types, there are a total of 87 unique possible advertisements (ignoring the random source MAC) possible, of which one is broadcast every second.

---

#### WiFi Spam

Provides an efficient and powerful toolkit for wireless security research, penetration testing, and network environment assessment.
- Broadcast fake SSIDs ‚Äì Creates up to a thousand WiFi access points with custom SSIDs.
- Wi-Fi Deauthentication Attack - Send deauthentication frames to disrupt client connections.
- Wi-Fi Scanner ‚Äì List nearby Wi-Fi networks with extended details.

![WiFi Spam Demo](2.assets/wifi_spam.webp)

In reality though, it is just advertising these network names without actually creating them. So there is no way you could connect to one of the "created" networks.

---

#### BadUSB

Launch computer‚Äësecurity attacks using a malware‚Äëladen USB device. MeowKit can emulate USB device‚Äëmode peripherals so your computer recognizes it as a standard input device‚Äîthink HID keyboard or Ethernet adapter‚Äîjust like a USB Rubber Ducky. You can script custom keyboard payloads to send any keystroke sequence and even fuzz‚Äëtest the USB stack on target devices.

1. **Connection & Preparation**  
   a. Connect MeowKit to your computer using a USB cable.  
   b. Copy `.txt` script files into the `/badusb/` folder on the device, or use the built-in SD card sample files from the firmware.

2. **Script Selection**  
   - **B Single Click**: Switch to the next script.  
   - **B Double Click**: Switch to the previous script.
