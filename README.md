#### Possible Issues & Solutions

##### a. Laser char
- The black residue on the edges of the laser-cut honeycomb cardboard is harmless.  
  - Avoid direct contact with the cut edges.  
  - If any dust gets on your hands, simply wash them before handling the device. 

##### b. Shipping and handling
- During transport, the battery may be discharged or the back cover may become loose.  
  - Recharge using the USB-C cable until the red LED turns off (indicating full charge).  
  - Tighten the back cover screws with a T5 screwdriver if needed.  

##### c. A/B button stiffness
- The A/B buttons may feel slightly stiff at first.  
  - With repeated use, pressing and rebound will become smoother and the tactile feel will improve.

#### BLE BEACON

A **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Beacon** is a device or software that continuously broadcasts customizable BLE advertising packets to nearby devices.  

These packets can interact with native system features on major platforms, including:  
- **iOS/iPadOS**: Spoofing Nearby Actions modals and Proximity Pair popups, potentially triggering system responses such as pairing prompts or, in some cases, system instability (e.g., crashes on iOS 17 for iPhone 12 or newer).  
- **Android**: Triggering Google Fast Pair or Samsung Easy Pair interfaces to initiate seamless device discovery and pairing.  
- **Windows**: Interfacing with Microsoft Swift Pair for quick Bluetooth device connections.  

This functionality is commonly used for **‚Äúpopup attacks‚Äù**, where devices instantly broadcast crafted advertising packets to induce system-level prompts for pairing or connection. While this demonstrates the capabilities of BLE communication and device discovery protocols, it can also expose security considerations in automated or unexpected device interactions.  

In practice, BLE Beacons like this are valuable for:  
- Rapid device provisioning and testing.  
- Security research on Bluetooth pairing protocols.  
- Developing custom pairing workflows for IoT, peripherals, or embedded devices.

#### WiFi Spam

A versatile wireless testing tool designed to interact with Wi-Fi networks in multiple advanced ways:  

- **Custom SSID Broadcasting**: Instantly creates up to a thousand Wi-Fi access points with configurable SSIDs, allowing for large-scale network simulation, stress testing, or UX experimentation.  
- **Deauthentication Monitoring**: Continuously monitors for Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks, enabling the detection of malicious attempts to disconnect clients from networks.  
- **Extended Network Scanning**: Lists nearby Wi-Fi networks with detailed information including SSID, BSSID, signal strength, channel, encryption type, and additional extended parameters.  

This module is primarily intended for **network research, security testing, and educational purposes**, providing engineers, researchers, and makers with the ability to explore Wi-Fi behavior, test client interactions, and study wireless protocol responses in controlled environments.
